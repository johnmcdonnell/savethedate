            <h2>Getting in</h2>
            <p><strong>Toronto Pearson Airport</strong> is the main international airport, but is somewhat far from the city center. Ground transport options are limited because the downtown shuttle has been canceled, but the new airport train won't open until mid 2015. The airport does have free WiFi.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxi</strong> Fixed fare to downtown. Time: ~45 min. Cost: $54 CAD + tip.</li>
                <li><strong>UberX</strong> Can be hailed using the free Airport WiFi if you don't have a Canadian data plan on your phone. See Uber's Toronto page <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/toronto">here</a>. Time: ~45 min. Cost: ~$55 CAD metered fare, no tip.</li>
                <li><strong>TTC Public Transit</strong> The <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Airport_service.jsp">192 "Airport Rocket"</a> provides a regular shuttle between Terminal 1 (Ground level), Terminal 3 (Arrivals Level) and Kipling Station at the end of the Bloor subway line. All the hotels are near stops on this line, so it's actually a fairly reasonable option if you've packed light. The Intercontinental is near St George Station, Four Seasons is near Bay Station, and the Bloor-Yonge station is literally in the Marriott's basement. Time: ~1 hour. Price: $3 CAD.</li>
                <li><strong>Rental Cars</strong> Rental cars are also available, but will likely be inconvenient in the city and expensive to park.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Billy Bishop Toronto Centre Airport</strong> provides convenient access to downtown Toronto and is served by Canada's best airline, <a href="http://flyporter.com">Porter</a>, but serves more limited array of routes. Those in the know (aka the bride and groom) book tickets to Midway and then change for Porter Airlines flights to Toronto Centre. They've also started a codeshare with JetBlue for some US destinations. Book on <a href="http://flyporter.com">Porter's website</a>. The airport does have free WiFi.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxi</strong> Metered fare. Time: ~15 min. Cost: ~$15 CAD + tip metered fare.</li>
                <li><strong>UberX</strong> Can be hailed using the free Airport WiFi if you don't have a Canadian data plan on your phone. See Uber's Toronto page <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/toronto">here</a>. Time: ~15 min. Cost: ~$14 CAD metered fare, no tip.</li>
                <li><strong>TTC Public Transit</strong> Porter provides a shuttle to Union station. From there you can subway to the Royal Conservatory. Time: ~30 min. Price: $3 CAD*.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Driving</strong> works pretty great if you have a car in driving distance. Note that traffic will probably be heavy no matter when you come in, and parking will be expensive. You could try to park cheaply in a suburb and subway in. If you are coming from the States, try to fuel up on the US side of the border as gas taxes in Canada are ~$2 per gallon higher than in the states. As they say, it's not cheaper just because they make it here.</p>

            <p><strong>Trains</strong> arrive downtown at Union Station at Front and Bay. <a href="http://viarail.ca">ViaRail</a> is very convenient from Windsor, Ottawa, or Montreal. From New York City and/or State, <a href="http://amtrak.com">Amtrak</a> offers a 12 hour train once a day that costs $100 each way from the city. It's slow and not particularly cheap, but it could be fun. The scenery is nice along the way.</p>

            <p><strong>Buses</strong> arrive downtown at Toronto Coach Terminal at Bay and Dundas. In our younger days this was our primary way of getting to the city from New York, because at about $30 for a 12 hour ride, <a href="http://megabus.com">MegaBus</a> is by far the cheapest option from New York.</p>

            <h2>Getting Around</h2>
            <p>Information about getting to the Royal Conservatory <a href = "http://performance.rcmusic.ca/plan-your-experience/directions-and-transit"</a>here</a><br></p>

            <p><strong>Walking</strong>. It will admittedly be freezing cold (high temperatures averaging 1Â° C). But all the hotels are about a 5 minute walk from Koerner Hall and each other, so if you suit up you should be able to make it. For Californians who aren't used to this, note that this is probably going to be 3 layer weather (2 sweaters and one large-ish wind-resistant coat).</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis</strong> can generally be hailed throughout downtown, although they are a little more expensive than in New York.</p>

            <p><strong>UberX</strong> is finally available in Toronto, but you need a data plan to use it. <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/toronto">Site here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>TTC</strong>, or the Toronto Transit commission, is quite efficient. Most major streets downtown have either a streetcar or a subway, so you generally require at most one transfer to get anywhere. Pay with tokens, which cost $3 CAD with bulk discounts available. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/TTCstreetcarmap-2005.png">Service map here</a>.</p>
